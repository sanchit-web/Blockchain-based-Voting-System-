Double Voting Prevention: Voter IDs can only be used once.

End Election Feature: Calculates and displays the winner, and saves the results to a timestamped .txt file.

Blockchain Viewer: Users can view the full blockchain structure with hashes.

📁 Technologies Used
Java

Swing GUI

SHA-256 (MessageDigest) for hashing

File Handling (for saving election results)

📸 Screenshots (optional)
Add screenshots of the UI (voting interface, blockchain display, and result screen).

📂 Project Structure
VotingSystem.java: Main application with GUI and blockchain logic

Block class: Represents each vote block

Blockchain class: Manages chain and vote tallying

📝 How to Run
Compile and run VotingSystem.java in any Java IDE or terminal.

🔒 Why Blockchain?
Using blockchain ensures that once a vote is recorded, it cannot be altered, and the entire voting history remains visible and verifiable. This increases trust in digital elections.
